 = Before You Begin =

Start the message persistence service:

{{{
mqtt_store:start().
}}}

 = Connecting =

 == Simple ==
{{{
mqtt_client:connect("172.16.50.128").
}}}

 returns {{{{ok, Pid}}}} on success

This call is synchronous.

 == Advanced ==
{{{
mqtt_client:connect("172.16.50.128", Port, Options).
}}}

where:
 * {{{Port}}} is the port to connect to, eg {{{1883}}}
 * {{{Options}}} is an array which can contain:
  * {{{{connect_timeout, Seconds}}} specifies how long the client should wait for a socket connection to the broker, or for the broker to acknowledge the connection attempt
  * {{{{client_id, ClientId}}}} specifies the id to connect as
  * {{{{keepalive, Seconds}}}} specifies how frequently in seconds to ping the broker eg {{{10}}} - note the client will explode if it does not receive a ping response before the next ping
  * {{{{retry, Seconds}}}} how frequently in seconds to resend QoS 1 or 2 messages that have not been acknowledged by the broker
  * {{{{clean_start, true}}}} forces the broker to drop pending messages and subscriptions for this client id
  * {{{{will, WillTopic, WillMessage, WillOptions}}}} specifies a message the broker will pass on when the client disconnects. {{{WillOptions}}} is an array that can contain the following elements:
   * {{{{qos, QoS}}}} indicating the quality of service to be used in delivering the message, either {{{0}}}, {{{1}}} or {{{2}}}
   * {{{{retain, true}}}} to indicate that the message should be retained, and delivered automatically to clients subscribing to the designated topic

 = Subscribing to a Topic =
 == Simple ==

{{{
mqtt_client:subscribe(R, Topic).
}}}

where:
 * {{{Pid}}} is a client pid returned by {{{mqtt_client:connect}}}
 * {{{Topic}}} is the name of a topic to subscribe to, eg {{{"topic"}}}.

This call is synchronous.

 == Advanced ==

{{{
gen_server:call(Pid, {mqtt_client, subscribe, [Topics]}).
}}}

where:
 * {{{Pid}}} is a client pid returned by {{{mqtt_client:connect}}}
 * {{{Topics}}} is an array of {{{sub}}} records, which feature the following fields:
  * {{{topic}}} the name of a topic to subscribe to, eg {{{"topic"}}}
  * {{{qos}}} the quality of service to request, either {{{0}}}, {{{1}}} or {{{2}}}

The definition for the {{{sub}}} record type is included in {{{include/mqtt.hrl}}}.

This call is asynchronous - your process will be sent a message of the form

{{{
{mqtt_client, subscribed, Subscriptions|
}}}

when the broker acknowledges your request. {{{Subscriptions}}} is an array of {{{sub}}} records containing the topics you requested a subscription for, and the quality of service levels you were granted by the broker.

 = Unsubscribing to a Topic =
 == Simple ==

{{{
mqtt_client:unsubscribe(Pid, Topic).
}}}

where:
 * {{{Pid}}} is a client pid returned by {{{mqtt_client:connect}}}.
 * {{{Topic}}} is the name of a topic to unsubscribe from, eg {{{"topic"}}}.

This call is synchronous.

 == Advanced ==

{{{
gen_server:call(Pid, {mqtt_client, unsubscribe, [Topics]}).
}}}

where:
 * {{{Pid}}} is a client pid returned by {{{mqtt_client:connect}}}
 * {{{Topics}}} is an array of {{{sub}}} records, which feature the following fields:
  * {{{topic}}} the name of a topic to subscribe to, eg {{{"topic"}}}

The definition for the {{{sub}}} record type is included in {{{include/mqtt.hrl}}}.

This call is asynchronous - your process will be sent a message of the form

{{{
{mqtt_client, unsubscribed, Subscriptions|
}}}

when the broker acknowledges your request. {{{Subscriptions}}} is an array of {{{sub}}} records containing the topics you requested to be unsubscribed from.

 = Disconnecting =

{{{
mqtt_client:disconnect(Pid).
}}}

where:
 * {{{Pid}}} is a client pid returned by {{{mqtt_client:connect}}}.
